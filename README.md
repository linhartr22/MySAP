This project represents my attempt to duplicate an 8-bit Breadboard CPU project by YouTuber Ben Eater. I have a YouTube series detailing my build progress at https://www.youtube.com/user/Plays2Hardball. It contains an Arduino sketch to program the EEPROMs and other documents.

If you found this interesting or useful please consider a donation to my PayPal account

appreciate your support.
